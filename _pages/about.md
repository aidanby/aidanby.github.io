I am an undergraduate student at Queen's University, currently pursuing a dual degree in **Computer Engineering** and **Mathematics**. My expected graduation date is **May 2021**.

I am interested in software engineering research, specifically in **mining software repositories, requirements engineering, and code testing**.

## Undergraduate Program
My undergraduate degree is one of the three *engineering science* programs at Queen's University. The [Math and Engineering](https://engineering.queensu.ca/explore-programs/undergraduate-programs/mathematics-and-engineering/) (specialized in computing) program involves courses in electrical engineering, computer science and applied math.
