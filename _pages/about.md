I am an undergraduate student at Queen's University, currently pursuing a dual degree in **Computer Engineering** and **Mathematics**. My expected graduation date is **May 2021**. 

During my undergrad I have interned as an embedded systems developer at [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en) on the [Display Abstraction Layer team](https://www.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2016/Program/amd_dal.pdf) and an investment banker at [GF Securities](http://en.gf.com.cn/about).

## Research
I am currently interested in software engineering research, specifically in **requirements engineering** and **software testing**. I aim to improve how developers write documentation throughout the lifespan of their software. My research tries to make documentation more accesible for new developers, non-technical stakeholders, and end-users.

I have had the opportunity to be advised by [Ying Zou](https://www.ece.queensu.ca/people/Y-Zou/index.html) at the [Software Reengineering Research Group](http://post.queensu.ca/~zouy/people.html), [Daniel Alencar da Costa](https://www.otago.ac.nz/info-science/people/daniel-alencardacosta.html) of [University of Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz/), and [Ahmed E. Hassan](http://research.cs.queensu.ca/home/ahmed/home/) of [SAIL](http://sail.cs.queensu.ca/). 

## Undergraduate Program
My undergraduate degree is one of the three *engineering science* programs at Queen's University. The [Math and Engineering](https://engineering.queensu.ca/explore-programs/undergraduate-programs/mathematics-and-engineering/) (specialized in computing) program involves courses in electrical engineering, computer science and applied math.
