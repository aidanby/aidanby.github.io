## About
I am a software engineering PhD student in the [Institute of Software Research](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University.

I am originally from Calgary Alberta. I completed my undergraduate degree from Queen's University, in Computer Engineering and Math.

My industry experiences include semidonductor, software, and finance:
- Machine learning research intern at Microsoft Research Redmond
- GPU driver developer at AMD on the [Display Abstraction Layer team](https://www.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2016/Program/amd_dal.pdf)
- Investment banking analyst at GF Securities, specifically in the IPO industrial team

## Research
My research tries to make documentation more accesible for new developers, non-technical stakeholders, and end-users. My goal is to use documentation to help developers automatically write code that is functional and readable. The documentation artifacts I have investigated include requirements documentation (MSR19'), API documentation (ICSE21'), and release documentation (EMSE21').
Specifically, I am interested in:
- Program synthesis
- Program analysis
- Natural Language Processing
