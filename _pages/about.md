Hi there, my name is Aidan.
I am a undergraduate engineering student at Queen's University. I am currently pursuing a dual degree in **Computer Engineering** and **Mathematics**.
I am interested in software engineering research, specifically in **mining software repositories, requirements engineering, and code testing**.
My other interests include jazz piano, golf, and body-building.  

## Research
Software testing is a complicated task that has previously been exclusive to experienced developers. However, with increasing demand for using software tools to solve business problems, non-technical personnel are joining in on the fun :smile:

**Behavior Driven Development (BDD)** is a tool that enables all stakeholders of a project to test code, using natural language syntax for code specification. Specification code and source code co-evolve together in unexpected ways, and I aim to identify and predict **co-changes** between specification and source code in BDD projects.

If you have any interest in BDD, or requirements engineering and software testing research as a whole, feel free to take a peak at my publication page. I am always looking for more developers to learn from and researchers to collaborate with.
